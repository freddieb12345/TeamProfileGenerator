TeamProfileGenerator                    [![license](images/MIT.svg)]

Description
    - The motivation behind this project is to create a command line application that allows a Team leader to input information about their team into it, and then creates a HTML file with all this info. 
    - This solves the problem of having to manually navigate to each individuals contact page, thereby saving you time. 
    - From this project, I learned how to use object oriented programming by utilising multiple classes. I also learned how to use testing effictively so you dont have to manually run the application after every change
